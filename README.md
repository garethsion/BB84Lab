# BB84Lab

The code here neads to be neatened, I intend to come back to it to analyse the experimental data much further, looking at measures given in Lluis Masanes's lecture notes. 

* Some parts of the code won't run unless another part has already been run. I need to tidy this
* There are some files in here which are superfluous, and need to be deleted
* I would like to add more functionality to the code
